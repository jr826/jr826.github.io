## Experience
This past summer, I worked under Cornell Professor David Winkler as a member of the [TABER] (http://www.eeb.cornell.edu/winkler/wordpress/?page_id=335) group. We used TI microcontrollers to design bird tags that would collect, store, and trasmit data to a basestation. My specific focus was on the memory management of the system. The programming of the microcontroller was done in C.
